anneal.m and anneal.py are original simulated annealing algorithms
anneal_v2.m is an enhancement from Eckhard Gauterin (HTW-Berlin). Eckhard modified the algorithm to accept the best solution when moving to a new "temperature" in the outer loop instead of selecting just the last solution. The algorithm appears to converge faster but also tends to find local optima versus the global optimum.
