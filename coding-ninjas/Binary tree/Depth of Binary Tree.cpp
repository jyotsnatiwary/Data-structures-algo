/*Depth of Binary Tree
Send Feedback
A rooted binary tree is called “nice”, if every node is either a leaf, or has exactly two children.
For example, the following tree is nice,
                           n
                         /   \
                        l     n
                             / \
                            n   l
                           / \
                          l   l
and the following tree is not,
                          n
                         / \
                       n     n
                      /
                     l
The leaves of a nice binary tree are labeled by the letter ‘l’, and other nodes are labeled by the letter ‘n’.
Given the pre-order traversal of a nice binary tree as a string, you are required to find the depth of the tree.
Output one line for each test case, containing a single integer, the depth of tree.
